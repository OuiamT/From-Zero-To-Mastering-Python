# üß† Learning some Fundamental Python:
This Python script demonstrates core programming concepts using for loops, string & integer operations, and basic logic. Below are the main topics covered.

## ‚úî What I learned:
+ For Loop with a **List**: A for loop allows iteration over a list to print items.
+ For Loop with a **String**: Strings are iterable in Python. You can loop through each character. Converting and processing one letter at a time.
+ For Loop with **range(start, end, step)**:
  - `start`: beginning of the range (inclusive)
  - `end`: end of the range (exclusive)
  - `step`: how much to increase each time
+ Shorthand Operations with **String** and **Integer**.
+ Slicing.
+ **shuffle()**: is a method from Python‚Äôs random module that randomly reorders the items in a list. 
+ **join()**: Converting list of words into a readable sentence or structured string output.

## üìå Bonus Knowledge:
### üêç Code Style ‚Äì Snake Case:
In `snake_case` all letters are lowercase and spaces between words are replaced with underscores (**_**), used in **variables**, **functions**, **file name** ..... 

### üßæ Escape Character:
| **Escape**   |  **Meaning**     |    **Input**   |   **Output**  |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
|  `\n`  | New line | `print("Hello \nWorld!`  |    Hello   |
                                                    World   |
|   `\t`  | Tab  | `print("Hello\tWorld")`   |  Hello  World|
|   `\\`   | Backslash | `print("C:\\Users\\Name")`  | C:\User\Name  |
|   `\'` or ``\"`  | Single quote (') or Double quote (") | `print("He said \"Hi\"")`  | He said "Hi"  |
