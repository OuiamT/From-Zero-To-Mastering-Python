# 🧠 Learning some Fundamental Python:
This Python script demonstrates core programming concepts using for loops, string & integer operations, and basic logic. Below are the main topics covered.

## ✔ What I learned:
+ For Loop with a **List**: A for loop allows iteration over a list to print items.
+ For Loop with a **String**: Strings are iterable in Python. You can loop through each character. Converting and processing one letter at a time.
+ For Loop with **range(start, end, step)**:
  - `start`: beginning of the range (inclusive)
  - `end`: end of the range (exclusive)
  - `step`: how much to increase each time
+ Shorthand Operations with **String** and **Integer**.
+ Slicing.
+ **shuffle()**: is a method from Python’s random module that randomly reorders the items in a list. 
+ **join()**: Converting list of words into a readable sentence or structured string output.

## 📌 Bonus Knowledge:
### 🐍 Code Style – Snake Case:
In `snake_case` all letters are lowercase and spaces between words are replaced with underscores (**_**), used in **variables**, **functions**, **file name** .....
