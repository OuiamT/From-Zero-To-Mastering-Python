# üß† Learning some Fundamental Python:
This Python script demonstrates core programming concepts using **for loops**, string & integer operations, and basic logic. Below are the main topics covered.

## ‚úî What I learned:
+ **For Loop** with a **List**: A for loop allows iteration over a list to print items.
+ **For Loop** with a **String**: Strings are iterable in Python. You can loop through each character. Converting and processing one letter at a time.
+ **For Loop** with **range(start, end, step)**:
  - `start`: beginning of the range (inclusive)
  - `end`: end of the range (exclusive)
  - `step`: how much to increase each time
+ We used **Underscore: "_"** in **for loop** when we don't have any variables to used it. 
+ Shorthand Operations with **String** and **Integer**.
+ Slicing.
+ **shuffle()**: is a method from Python‚Äôs random module that randomly reorders the items in a list. 
+ **join()**: Converting list of words into a readable sentence or structured string output.

## üìå Bonus Knowledge:
### üêç Code Style ‚Äì Snake Case:
In `snake_case` all letters are lowercase and spaces between words are replaced with underscores (**_**), used in **variables**, **functions**, **file name** ..... 

### üßæ Escape Character:
**Escape characters** let you add special effects in text, like a new line or a tab.

| **Escape** | **Meaning**| **Example**| **Output** |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| `\n`   | New line                   | `print("Hello \nWorld")`          | Hello <br>World   |
| `\t`   | Tab     | `print("Hello\tWorld")`          | Hello‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉWorld       |
| `\\`   | Backslash (`\`)            | `print("C:\\Users\\Name")`       | C:\Users\Name      |
| `\'` or `\"`| Single quote (`'`) or Double quote (`"`) | `print("He said \"Hi\"")` | He said "Hi" |
| `\r`   | Carriage return            | `print("Hello there!\rWorld")`          | World there! |
| `\b`   | Backspace                  | `print("Helloo\b")`              | Hello  |
