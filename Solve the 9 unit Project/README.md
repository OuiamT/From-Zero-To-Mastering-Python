# 🔐 Caesar Cipher – Encryption & Decryption:
This project demonstrates a simple **Caesar Cipher**, one of the oldest encryption techniques.
It allows you to **encrypt** a message by shifting letters forward in the alphabet and **decrypt** it by shifting them back.

## 🚀 How to Use:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter a message (plain text for encryption, or encrypted text for decryption).
3. Enter the shift number (an integer).
4. The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message.

## ❗ Notes:
- Encryption and decryption must use the same shift number.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Non-letters remain unchanged.
