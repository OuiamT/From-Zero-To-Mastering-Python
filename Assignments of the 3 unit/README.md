# ðŸ§  Learning 'if', 'elif' and 'else' in Python:
This folder contains notes and practice for understanding conditional statements in Python.

## âœ” What i learned:
- **F-Strings**:
'F-strings' are easy way to put variables inside a string. To use them, just write the letter 'f' before your string, and put
the variable inside curly brackets {}.

- **If Condition**:
We use this code block:

if condition:
    If the condition is true, the code will run.
elif condition:
    It check another condition if the first is not true.
else:
    It runs when none of the above conditions are true.

- **Indentation**:
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code (it is best to leave 4 spaces). If you don't indent correctly, Python will
give you an error.
