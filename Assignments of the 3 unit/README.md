# ðŸ§  Learning 'if', 'elif' and 'else' in Python:
This folder contains notes and practice for understanding conditional statements in Python.


## âœ” What i learned:
- **F-Strings**:
'F-strings' are easy way to put variables inside a string. To use them, just write the letter 'f' before your string, and put
the variable inside curly brackets {}.

- **If Condition**:
We use this code block:
if condition:
    If the condition is true, the code will run.
elif condition:
    It check another condition if the first is not true.
else:
    It runs when none of the above conditions are true.

- **Indentation**:
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code (it is best to leave 4 spaces). If you don't indent correctly, Python will
give you an error.

- **String Methods: lower() and uppe()**:
These are useful string methods in Python that help you to change the case of letters.
ðŸ’  lower() ---> Changes all letters in a string to "small letters".
ðŸ’  upper() ---> Changes all letters in a string to "big letters".

- **Nested if conditions**:
A nested 'if' is when you put one 'if' statement **inside** another 'if'

- **ASCII Art**:
**ASCII Art** is a way of creating pictures using only **keyboard characters** like letters, numbers and symbols.
These two SitWebs creating pictures in **ASCII** and **emogies**:
