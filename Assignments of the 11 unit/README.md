# 📘 Python Notes:
## 🧩 Difference Between `return` and `print`:
Use **return** when you need the function’s output later in your code. Use **print()** only for displaying information.

## ⏰ Import time:
The **time** module allows you to work with time-related functions in Python.
### Example:
```
import time

print("Start")
time.sleep(3)  # pause execution for 3 seconds
print("End")
```
