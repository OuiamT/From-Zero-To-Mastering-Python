# 🐢 Python Turtle Module:
**The Turtle** module in Python is a beginner-friendly graphics library in **OOP** that allows you to create drawings, animations, and interactive programs using simple commands.
### 🔹 Main Classes:
It works with two main classes:
**1. `Turtle` Class**:
Used to create and control a “turtle” — the pen that moves and draws on the screen.

**2. `Screen` Class**:
Represents the drawing window.
You use it to control window settings such as size, background color, input dialogs, etc.
## 🖥️ Screen Class:
• `Screen().exitonclick()`:
Closes the window when you click on it. Useful for ending programs.
• `screen.setup(width, height)`:
Sets the window size.
• `screen.bgcolor(color_name)`:
Changes the background color.
• `screen.reset()` vs `screen.clear()`:
**reset()** → Clears the screen and resets the turtle (position, color, speed, etc).
**clear()** → Clears the drawings only but keeps settings the same.
• `window.textinput(title, prompt)`:
Opens a dialog box to take text input from the user.
