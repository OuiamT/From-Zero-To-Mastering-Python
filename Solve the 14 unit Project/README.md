# 🐢 Turtle Race Game:
A fun and interactive mini-game built using **Python’s turtle module**.
The player bets on which colored turtle (red, blue, or green) will win the race, then watches the turtles compete in real time. After the race ends, the game displays whether the player won or lost.

## 🧠 How It Works:
1. The game displays an input box asking the user to guess the winning turtle color.
2. Three turtles are created and placed at the starting line.
3. Each turtle moves forward a random amount (1 to 4 pixels) until one crosses the finish line.
4. The winning turtle's color is checked against the player's choice.
5. A message is displayed indicating whether the player won or lost.
