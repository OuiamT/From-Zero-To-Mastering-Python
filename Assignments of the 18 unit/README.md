### handling Files:
- open to open my file.
- file.read(nbr)
- file.close(). Why we should close any file after we opened?
- with open(path) as filename ->> to open and close automotaly
- open(path, mode=):
  - r: read
  - w: write
  - a: append
  - x: creat
  - w+: write and read. we use file.seek(nbr)
- the difference between abs path and relative path.
