# User Management System:
A simple application that allows administrators to manage users by adding, viewing, and organizing user data.
This project demonstrates **Python OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** and  **input validation**.
## 🧠 How It Works:
1. Create a new user by entering:
  - first name.
  - last name.
  - email.
  - password.

2. Display All Users by view all registered users with their details (name, email, and account status).
3. Exit Safely by Close the application gracefully at any time.
