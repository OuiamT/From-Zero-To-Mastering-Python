# 🥘 Recipe Collection Program:
This Python script allows users to **create** and **display simple cooking recipes**.
Users can input the recipe **name**, **ingredients**, **cooking time**, and **preparation instructions**.
After entering the information, the program waits a few seconds and then shows the complete recipe details in a neat format.

2. Enter:
- Recipe name
- Ingredients (comma-separated)

- Cooking instructions
3. Wait a few seconds…
4. The program will display your complete recipe details.
