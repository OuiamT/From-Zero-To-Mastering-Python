Blackjack Console Game
-----------------------------------

This script implements a simple console-based version of the classic Blackjack (also known as Twenty-One)
card game.

The player competes against the computer (dealer) to reach a card total as close to 21 as possible
without exceeding it.
Face cards (J, Q, K) are represented as 10, and Aces (A) can count as 11 or 1 depending on the player's hand.

Modules:
    - os: Used to clear the console screen between rounds.
    - time: Used to create brief pauses for a smoother game experience.
    - random: Used to shuffle the deck of cards.
    - twenty_one_art: Provides a visual ASCII logo for the game.

Constants:
    - BLACK_JACK (int): Target score for winning (21).
    - MAX_OF_TAKE_CARDS (int): Maximum threshold for taking additional cards (17).

Game Steps:
    1. The game shuffles a standard deck represented as numeric values.
    2. Both player and computer are dealt two initial cards.
    3. The player decides whether to draw more cards.
    4. The computer draws automatically according to dealer rules.
    5. The result is displayed, and the player is prompted for another round or not.
