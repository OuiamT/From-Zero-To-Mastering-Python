# 🃏 Blackjack Game (Twenty-One):
This Python script implements a console-based **Blackjack (Twenty-One) game** where a player competes against the computer (dealer).
The goal is simple: get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

## 🎯 Game Objective:
- **Blackjack (21)** is the winning score.
- **Face cards (J, Q, K)** count as 10.
- **Card (A)** can be **1** or **11**, depending on what benefits your hand.
- The player plays against the computer dealer, following basic **Blackjack rules**.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The deck (list of card values) is shuffled.
2. Both the player and computer receive two cards.
3. The player can choose to take more cards (y) or hold.
4. The computer automatically draws cards until its total reaches 17 or more.
5. The winner is determined based on who is closer to 21 without exceeding it.
