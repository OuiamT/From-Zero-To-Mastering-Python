Some note about pandas package:
- the diff between series and dataframe
- to read a csv file: pandas.read_csv(path)
- dataframe.to_dict -> to convert it to dictionary
- dataframe["name_of_column"].to_list -> to convert it to list
- Average (mean, median, mode)
- dataframe["name_of_column].value_count()
- how to selection from a type
- pd.groupby()
