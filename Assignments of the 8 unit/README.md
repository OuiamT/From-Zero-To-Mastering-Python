# 🍎🍌🍐 Hangman Game:
This project is a simple **Hangman-style** word guessing game using random fruit names.
It’s built step by step in three versions, each adding more functionality.

## ✔ What I learned:
The diferene between **break**, **continue** and **pass**:
- **Break**: This statement is used to exit the loop immediately, even if the loop condition is **True**.
- **Continue**: This statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
- **Pass**: It is a null statement in **Python**, it does nothing when execute.

## 🛠️ Tools:
**[Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/)**: It is a tool was used to create flowcharts for understanding the game logic.
