# ðŸ§  Learning Functions:
A **function** is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can define a function once and call it whenever needed.

## âœ… Why Use Functions?
- **Reusability**: Write once, use many times.
- **Modularity**: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and update code.
- **Readability**: Makes code cleaner and easier to understand.

## ðŸ”§ Function Structure:
```
function functionName():
     Code block
```
After defining a function, you **call** it:

`functionName()`

## ðŸ§ª Tips for writing good Functions:
- Keep them short and focused.
- Use descriptive names.
- Write it on snake_case. 
- Add docstrings or comments if neede
